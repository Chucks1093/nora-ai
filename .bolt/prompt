Please make everything very easy to follow. Also make the code neat and short. Don't over complicate things so that I can easily edit the code output. Also, take note of your changes in case I tell you to erase them. In the response to my prompts, after showing the files changed, add no conclusions. just end it there.
In discuss mode, keep the responses very short and straight to the point.
